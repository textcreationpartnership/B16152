            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </note> The one is the knowlege of the law of God, vnderstandynge it spiritually, as Christ expoūdeth it Mathew in the .v. vi. and .vii. chapter: so that the roote and lyfe of all lawes is thys: Loue thy LORDE God with al thyne hart, all thy soule, and all thy myghte, and thy neghboure as thy selfe for his sake: and that loue only, be the fulfyllynge of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law (as Paule teacheth,) and that what soeuer dede we do, and not of that loue, that same fulfylleth no lawe in the syght of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:176389:2"/>
            <p> And the other is to knowe the promises <note place="margin">Gospell.</note> of mercye, whyche are in oure saueoure Christ, vnderstandynge them also purely wythoute all leuen, after the mercyfullest fashion as scripture expresseth them, and after all fatherlye loue and kyndnesse of God vnto al that repēt towarde the sawe and beleue in Christe.</p>
            <p>And to haue this profession wrytten in thyne harte, is to consent vnto y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> law that it is ryghteous, and good, and to loue it in thyne harte &amp; to submyt thyselfe thervnto for to learne it, and to rule and square all thy dedes therby, &amp; thē to beleue in Christ that for hys sake, all thy synnes whyche thou dyddest before y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> knowlege of this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession, are forgeuē the clerly, both pena &amp; culpa (to vse y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Romysh termes,) and that for none other satisfaction to Godwarde, then Christes bloude, and euen so, that all the synne which we do after this knowlege ether of chaunce, ignoraunce, infyrmyte, negligence, or prouoked and ouercomme of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flesh, is forgeuē vs lykwyse both pena and culpa thorow repentaunce and fayth in Christe wythoute oure satisfaction of workes to Godwarde.</p>
            <p>Not wythstondynge we beynge all
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:176389:2"/> sonnes of one God, &amp; seruauntes of one Christ must agre amonge our selues, &amp; he that hath offended, must mekely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege his fault, and offer hymselfe to make amendes vnto the vtmost of hys power, and yf he haue not where wyth, and axe forgeuenesse for Christes sake, the other is bounde to forgeue hym. Nother wyth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out reconcylinge hym selfe vnto hys bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maye ony man be at the fyrst recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto the profession of Christes fayth, nor continue therin, nor be receaued in agayne yf he be for hys open offences put therout. For how can a man loue hys neghboure as well as hymselfe, &amp; be sory that he hath hurt hym, excepte he shulde offer hymselfe to make amendes?</p>
            <p>And we muste from hence forth walke in the lyfe of penaunce (yf ye wyll haue it so called) and after the doctrine of Christ euery man tame hys fleshe wyth prayer fastynge, and the continual meditacyons of Christes Penaunce and passions for vs, and of the holy sayntes: and with such abstinence, and kynde of lyuing as euery man thinketh moost mete for hys cōplex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ion, the yonger confessyng theyr infirmi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> elder, discreter, &amp; better learned
<pb facs="tcp:176389:3"/> and axynge theyr aduyce and wholsome counsell for the repressynge of theyr disea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses, but all to tame the flesh, and to serue thy neghbour, wythout ony supersticious mynde.</p>
            <p>But to Godwarde is ther no satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion saue fayth in Christes bloude out of a repentynge harte. For oure outwarde dedes can not be referred vnto God to do hym seruice in hys owne persone, and to helpe hym or make hym better there wyth. We can do no more with thē, wer they neuer so perfecte, and done wyth all loue, then satisfye the lawe for the present tyme, and do oure duety vnto oure negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, and tame oure owne fleshe, but not to make satisfaction to God for synne that is once past. The synne that is once commytted must God forgeue frely of a fatherly loue for Christes sake.</p>
            <p>When God visiteth vs with sycknes, pouerte, or what so euer aduersite it be, he doth it not of a tyrannous mynde to satisfye hys luste in oure sufferrynge of euell, to make satisfaccion for the synne that is paste, of the whiche we repent and be sory: But of a fatherly loue, to make vs knowe oure selfes, and fele hys
<pb n="iiii" facs="tcp:176389:3"/> mercy, and to tame the flesh, and to kepe vs from synnynge agayne. As no natural father punyssheth hys chylde because he delyteth in tormentynge of hym, to take satisfaction for the synne that is paste. But fyrst teacheth kyndly and sufferreth and forgeueth once or twyse, and then at the laste, when he seyeth the body so wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton that the chylde can not contynue in the ryghte waye, for the rage of wylde lustes, he beateth hym, to subdue the flesh only and to tame it, that the doctryne of the father may haue hyr due course in the harte of the chylde, &amp; shulde not be choked wyth sustes, and concupiscences of oure wycked nature.</p>
            <p>Euen so is it of God, yf ony of hys chyldren that haue professed his law, and the faythe of oure saueoure, be negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to tame hys fleshe, wyth prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge, and gooddedes after the doctryne of Christe, he wyll surelye scourge hym to brynge hym in to the ryghte waye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and to kepe hym that the doctryne of hys soules health peryshe not in hym. But he taketh not hys mercye from vs, nor thynketh on the synne y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is paste, after that we repente and be full conuerted,
<pb facs="tcp:176389:4"/> but absolueth vs both a pena and culpa for Christes sake, and is as myghtye and as mercyfull to do it for Christes sake, as the B. of Rome for mony, besides that he hath promysed mercyfully so to do.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>¶ The knowlege of our baptyme is the keye and the lyght of the scripture.</head>
               <p>ANd agayne as he whyche knoweth hys letters well, and can spell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, can not but reade (yf he be diligēt:) and as he which hath cleare eyes wythout impediment or let, and walketh therto in the lyght and open daye can not but se, yf he attende and take hede: euen so who so euer hath the profession of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme wrytten in hys harte, can not but vnderstonde the scripture, yf he exercise hymselfe therin, and compare one place to another, and marke the maner of speche, &amp; axe here and there the meanynge of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of them that be better exercysed than he is.</p>
               <p>For as the doctrine whiche we shulde <note place="margin">The keye &amp; lyght of the Scripture.</note> be taught before we were baptysed, and for lacke of age is deferred vnto the yeares
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:176389:4"/> of discrecyon is the keye, that byndeth &amp; lowseth, locketh and vnlocketh the consci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence of all synners: euen so that lesson, where it is vnderstande, is onely y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> keye that openeth all the scripture, and euen y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole scripture in it selfe gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a narowe compasse and brought in to a compendiousnesse, and tyll thou be taught that lesson, that thyn hart fele the swetnesse of it, the scripture is locked and shut vp from the, and so darke, that thou couldest not vnderstande it, though Peter, Paul or Christ hymselfe dyd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it vnto the, nomore than a blynd man can se, though thou set a candell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, or shewest hym the Sonne, or poyntest with thy fynger vnto that thou woldest haue hym to loke vpon.</p>
               <p>Now be we all baptysed: But alas <note place="margin">How y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture is loc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked vp from our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge.</note> not one from the hyest vnto the lowest euer taught the profession or meanynge therof. And therfore we remayne all blynde generally, as well our great Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynes for all theyr hygh learnyng, which they seme to haue, as the lay people: yee and so muche the more blynde are our great clerkes, that where the laye people for a great nombre of them are taughte

Whan Paule by thys worde lettre vnderstode the lawe geuen by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to condempne all consciences and to robbe them of all ryghteousnesse, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> promyses of mercy that are in Christ.</p>
               <p>Heresye spryngeth not of the scripture
<pb facs="tcp:176389:7"/> no more than darkenesse of the Sonne, but it is a darke cloude that spryngeth out of the blynde hartes of ypocrites, and couereth the face of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture, and blyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth theyr eyes, that they can not behold the bryght beames of the scripture.</p>
               <p>The whole summe than of altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is thys: Yf oure hartes were taught the appointmēt made betwene God &amp; vs in Christes bloude, whan we were bapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed, we had the key to open the scripture, and lyght to se and perceaue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of it, and the scripture shulde be ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sy to vnderstande. And because we be not taught that profession, it is the cause why the scripture is so darke, and so farre passynge oure capacite. And the cause why oure exposicions are heresyes, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we be wronge taught, and corrupt wyth false opinions before hande, &amp; made here tykes yer we come at the scripture, and haue corrupte it, and it not vs: as the tayste of the sycke maketh wholsome and well seasoned meate bytter, weerysh and vnsauery. Neuerthelesse yet the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abydeth pure in herselfe and bryght, so that he whych is sounde in the faythe, shal atonce perceaue that the iudgement
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:176389:7"/> of the heretykes is corrupte in theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posytions, as an whole man doth fele at once euen with smellynge to the meate that the tayste of the sycke is infected. And with the scripture shal they euer im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue heresyes and false exposytions, for the scripture purgeth herselfe, euen as y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> water once in the yeare casteth al fylthy nesse vnto the sydes of it. Whiche to be true, ye se by the authorite of Paule .ii. Timothe the .iii. Chapter, sayenge: All the scripture was geuen of God by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracyon, and is good to teache with all, to improue: and so forth. And by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample of Christ and the Apostles, howe they confoūded the Iewes with the same scripture which they had corrupt, &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stode them amisse after theyr owne dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse: and as ye se by the ensample of vs now also, how we haue manifestly impro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued the ypocrites in an hundreth textes, whiche they had corrupte to proue theyr false opinions, brought in besydes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, and haue dryuen them of. And they be fledde and openly confesse vnto theyr shame, that they haue no scripture, and synge another songe, and say they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them by the mouth of the Apostles.
<pb facs="tcp:176389:8"/> Vnto the which stoppyng of theyrs I an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swer here grosly, seynge they are answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red befor: That as he were a foole which wolde trust hym to tell his mony in hys absēce, that hath pycked hys purse before his face: euen so syth ye haue corrupt the open scripture before our eyes, and are takē w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> maner, that ye can not denye: we were mad to beleue that it, whych hath lyen .xv. c. yeare as you saye in your rottē mawes, shulde nowe be wholsome for vs, ye haue chewed and mingled it wyth your poyson spatle. Can ye beare vs in hande and persuade vs thynke ye wyth youre so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrye to beleue that ye shulde ministre your secrete tradicions wythout grounde truely, whan we se you ministre the open scripture falsly? Can ye bewytch our wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wyth youre poetry, to beleue, that ye shulde ministre youre secrete tradicions for oure profyte, whan we se you corruppe the open scripture to the losse of our sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les for your profyte? Nay it is an hūdreth tymes more lykely that ye shulde be falser in secrete thynges than in open. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the very sacramentes whyche the scripture testifyeth, that Chryste hymselfe ordened them, we muste haue an eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:176389:8"/> your hande, how ye mynistre them. And as we restore the scripture vnto hyr ryght vnderstondynge from youre false gloses: euen so delyuer we y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> sacramentes and ceremonyes vnto theyr ryght vse frō youre abuse. And that must we do wyth the scripture, which can corrupte no man that commeth thereto wyth a meke sprete, sekynge there only to fashion hymselfe lyke Christ, accordynge to the profession and vowe of our baptyme. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyse, he shall there fynde the myghtye power of God, to altre hym, and chaūge hym in the inner man a lytle and lytle in processe, vntyll he be full shapen after the ymage of our saueour, in knowlekege and loue of all truth and power to worke there after.</p>
               <p>Finally then for as muche as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture is the lyght and lyfe of Gods electe, and that myghty power, wher with God treateth them and shapeth them, after y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> symilitude, lykenesse and very fashion of Christ, and therfore sustenaunce, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, and strength to corage them, that they maye stonde fast, and endure and merylye beare theyr soules health, where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyth the lustes of the fleshe are subdued,
<pb facs="tcp:176389:9"/> and kylled, and the sprete mollifyed and made softe, to receaue the print of the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of oure saueoure Iesu. And for as muche as the scripture is so pure of it self that it can corrupte no man, but the wyc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked only, whiche are infect before hande, and yer they come at it, corruppe it wyth the heresyes that they brynge with them. And for as much as the complaynt of the hypocrytes that the scriptur maketh here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tykes is vayne and fayned, and y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> reasons where wyth they wold proue that the lay people ought not to reade the scripture is false, wycked, and the frute of rottē trees: therfore are they faythfull seruauntes of Christ and faythful ministres and dispen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sers of hys doctrine, and true harted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theyr bretheren, which haue geuen themselues vp in to the hand of God, and put them selues in ieoperdy of all perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, theyr very lyfe despysed, and haue translated the scripture purely and wyth good conscience, submyttyng themselues and desyrynge them that can, to amende theyr translation, or (yf it please them) to translate it themselues, after theyr beste maner, yee and let them sowe to theyr gloses, as many as they thynke they can
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:176389:9"/> make cleue therto, &amp; then put other mens translation out of the waye.</p>
               <p>Howe be it thoughe God hathe so wrought with them, that a greate part is translated, yet as it is not ynough that the father and the mother haue bothe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the chylde, and brought it into thys worlde, except they care for it, and brynge it vp tyll it can helpe it selfe: Euē so it is not ynoughe to haue translated, though it were the whole scripture in to the vulgare and commune tunge, excepte we also brought agayne the lyght to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstonde it by, and expell that darke cloude, whiche the hypocrites haue spred ouer the face of the scripture, to blynd the ryght sence and true meanynge therof. And therfor are ther diuerse introductiōs ordeyned for you, to teache you the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of your baptyme, the only lyght of the scripture: one vpō the epistle of Paul to the Romaynes, and another called: The pathway into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture. And for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> same cause, haue I taken in hāde to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thys epistle of saynt Ihon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Euan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geliste, to edifye the laye man, &amp; to teache hym how to read the scripture, &amp; what to seke therin, &amp; that he may haue to answer
<pb facs="tcp:176389:10"/> the hypocrites, and to stoppe theyr mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes wythall.</p>
               <p>And fyrste vnderstande that all the epistles that the Apostles wrote, are the Gospell of Christe, though all that is the Gospell be not an Epistle. It is called a Gospell, that is to saye glad tydynges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an open preachynge of Christe: and an Epistle, because it is sent as a letter or a byll to them that are absent.

               <p>In that saynt Ihon sayeth.

               <p>And when he sayeth: Which we herd, &amp; sawe wyth oure eyes, and our handes han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dled
<pb facs="tcp:176389:11"/> hym, he testifyeth that Christ is very man also, as he doth in the begynnynge of hys Gospell, sayenge: The worde or that thynge was made fleshe, that is, became man. And thus we haue in playne &amp; open wordes a manifest article of oure fayth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our saueour Christ is very god &amp; very mā.</p>
               <p>Whiche article who so euer not only beleueth, but also beleueth in it, thesame is the sonne of God, and hath euerlastynge lyfe in hym, and shall neuer come into cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnacion, as it is wrytten Ihon the .i. He gaue them power to be the sonnes of God, in that they beleued is hys name. And Ihō .iii. he that beleueth in the sonne, hath euerlastyngelyfe. And a lytle before in the sayde chapter: He that beleueth in hym shall not be cōdemned. And to beleue in the wordes of thys article, is that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of Christes flesh and drynkyng hys bloude, of the which is spoken Ihō .vi. The wordes whych I speake are sprete and lyfe and the fleshe profyteth not at all, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the fleshly eatynge of his body, &amp; of the fleshly drynkynge of his bloude. Ther is therfore great difference betwene <note place="margin">To beleue in Christe.</note> beleuyng that ther is a God &amp; that Christ is God and mā, and to beleue in God and

               <p>But as he which feleth not his disease, can longe for no health: euen so it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possyble for ony man to beleue in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bloude excepte Moses haue had hym fyrste in cure, and wyth hys lawe haue robbed hym of hys ryghteousnesse, and condemned hym vnto euerlastynge death and haue shewed hym vnder what damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they are in by byrthe in Adam. And howe all theyr dedes (appeare they neuer so holy) are yet but damnable synne because they can refer nothynge vnto the glorye of God, but seke themselues, theyr owne profyte, honoure and glorye.

But as soone as the lawe (whose nature is to vtter synne.

And therfore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates loth to lose theyr hygh authorite &amp; to let the people go fre out of theyr yocke beganne to turne theyr tale and synge a newe songe, howe that thys penaūce was enioyned to make satisfaction to God for the synne that was committed, robbynge our soules of the frute of Christes bloude and makynge vs image seruaūtes, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge oure dedes vnto the person of God and worshyppynge hym as an ymage of <note place="margin">Here was purgatorye kyndled.</note> our owne ymaginatiō with bodely worke saynge morouer: Yf we wold not do suche penaunce here at theyr iniunctions, we must do it in another worlde, and fayned purgatory where we muste suffre .vii. yeares for euery sinne.

               <p>And the sacramēt of penaūce they thus describe: Contrition, Confession, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfaction.

And in theyr description they haue clene excluded the fayth in the satisfactiō of Christes bloude, which only bringeth lyfe and the sprite of life, &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousnesse, and without the which it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God. Hebr. xi. In whose steade they haue put in the presumpcyon of our owne workes. And for lack of trust in Christes bloude, our contritiō is but a frutelesse sorowe in the respecte of hell, which maketh vs hate the lawe styll, and consequently God that made it, where true contrition annexed with fayth is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe in respect of the lawe, vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which we consent that it is good, and loue it, &amp; therfor mourne partely because we haue offended it, and partely because we lacke power to fulfyll it as we wolde.</p>
               <p>These thynges to be true oure prelates knowe by opē historyes, as wel, as that it

But when God hath bounde hymselfe to sende me aungels or sayntes, or an angel or saynt, he hath not promysed to sende this angel or that, or this or that saint. And therfore whan I appoynt God whom he shal send, and bynde hym where he hath not boūde hymselfe, to sende me what saynt I wyl, I tempt God. And thus this chosynge of seueral sayntes is but temptynge of God. And yet we do worse then this: for we leaue the way of Christes bloude and go not to God thorow hym, but runne to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> sayntes in a testament of our owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge,
<pb facs="tcp:176389:32"/> &amp; wyll that they ether saue vs them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues for our ymage seruyce, or compell God for theyr merytes sakes to saue vs. Why goest thou not vnto thy father thyn owneselfe? I am a synner wyll they saye &amp; dare not. Yf thou go in the ryght waye, thou hast no synne. Christe hath taken all thy synnes from the, and God hath no rod in hys hande, nor loketh foure, but merely, that it is a lust to beholde hys cherfull coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce, and offereth the hys hande. But thys waye is stopped vp thorow vnbelefe, and therfore we seke another whyche is no way to lyfe, but vnto euerlastynge death. We wyll not loke on the lawe wyth open eyes, and therfore haue we no due repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and so no lust to herken vnto the Gospell of gladde tydynges in Christes bloude. And where the ryght waye is set before vs, &amp; we of malyce wyll not walke therin, God can not but let the deuell play wyth vs, and iuggle our eyes to confirme vs in blyndnesse.</p>
               <p>But after what maner doth Christe <note place="margin">How christ prayeth for vs.</note> pray for vs? Verely Christ in the dayes of hys mortall flesh suffred and prayed for al that shalbe saued, and optayned, and was herde, and had hys peticions graunted. And he made satisfacciō, and purged, and
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:176389:32"/> purchassed forgeuenesse, euen then for al the synnes that euer shalbe forgeuē: And his prayenge for vs, and beynge a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour nowe, is, that the remembraunce of all that he dyd for vs, is present in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sight of god the father as fresh, as in the houre he dyd them, yee y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same houre is yet pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent and not past in the syghte of God. And Christ is now a kyng and raygneth and hath receaued power of all that he prayed for, to do it hymselfe, and y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> when so euer the electe call for ought in his na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, he sendeth helpe euen of the power, which he hath receaued: yee yer they axe, he sendeth his sprete in to theyr hartes, to moue them to axe. So that it is his gyfte that we desyre ought in his name. And in all that we do or thynke well, he preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs with his grace: yee he careth for vs yer we care for our selues, and when we be yet euel, he sendeth to call vs, and draweth vs with suche power, that oure hart is can not but consente and come. And the angels stande by and behold the testament of the electe, how we shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued into theyr fellowship, and se all y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> grace that Christ shall poure out vpō vs. And they reioyce and prayse God for his infinite mercy, and are glad and lōge for
<pb facs="tcp:176389:33"/> vs, and of very loue are ready agaynst all houres when we shall call for helpe in Christes name, to come and helpe. And Christ sendeth them when we call in his name, and yer we call, euen whyle we be yet euel &amp; happely persecut y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraūce (as Paul dyd) the angels wayte vpō vs to kepe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the deuels slaye vs not, before the tyme of our callynge be come.</p>
               <p>Now yf an angell shulde appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the, what woldest thou saye vnto him? Yf thou praydest hym to helpe, he wolde answere: I do. Christe hath sent me to helpe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>, and beleue that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> angels be euer aboute y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> to helpe. Yf thou desyredest him to praye for the to optayne this or that, he wolde saye: Christ hath prayed, &amp; hys prayer is herde, or what so euer thou ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in his name, he wyl shewe the al that God wolde do to the, and what he wolde also haue the to do. And yf thou bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedest so, then werest thou safe. Yf thou desyredest hym to saue the with hys me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes. He wolde answere that he had no merytes (but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Christ only is LORDE of all merytes) nor saluacyon, but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Christ is LORDE of saluacion. Wylte y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be saued by merytes wold the angel saye, then praye to God in Christes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

Yf thou woldest promyse hym to worshyppe hym wyth ymage seruyce, that is to stycke vp a candle before hys ymage, or suche an ymage as he appeared to the in, he wolde answere that he were a sprete, and delyted in no candle lyghte, but wold byd the geue a candle vnto thy neghboure that lacketh, yf thou haddest to many. And so wolde he answere the, yf thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest put mony in a boxe for hym, or clothe hys ymage in clothe of golde, or put goldē shues vpon his ymages foote. Yf thou say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest that thou woldest buylde a chappel in his name, he wolde answere that he dwelt in no house made wyth stones, but wolde byd the go to the churches that are made already, and learne of the preacher there howe to beleue, and howe to lyue, and ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure God in the sprete, for the whyche cause churches were chefelye buylded, and for quyetnesse to praye. And yf ther be no church, then to geue of it that thou mayest spare to helpe that one were buylded, to be a preachynge, and a prayenge house, and
<pb facs="tcp:176389:34"/> of worshyppyng God in sprete, and not of ymage seruyce.</p>
               <p>And yf Paule appeared vnto the, what other thynge coulde he answere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so then that he were a sprete, and wolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse all thy ymage seruyce? And yf thou speake to Paule of hys merytes, he can none otherwyse answere the, then he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his Corinthians, that he dyed for no mans synnes, &amp; that no man was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysed in his name, to trust in hys merites. He wolde saye, I buylded all men vpon Christes merytes, preachyng that all that repented and beleued in hys name, shulde be saued, and taken from vnder the wrath, vengeaunce, and damnacion of the lawe, and be put vnder mercy and grace. And by thys faythe was I saued from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and put vnder mercy and grace and made one wyth Christe to haue my parte wyth hym, and he wyth me, or rather to make a chaunge: that he shulde haue all my synnes, and I his mercy &amp; the gyftes of his grace, and become glorious wyth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ornamentes of his ryches. And of my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueoure Christ I receaued this lawe, that I shulde loue my brethren, all Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte as tenderly as he loued them. And I consented vnto thys lawe, for it semed
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:176389:34"/> ryghte, and became a scoler to learne it. And as I profyted in the knowlege, fayth and loue of Christ, so I grewe in the loue of my brethren, and suffred all thynges for theyr sakes, and at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> last waxed so per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fecte, that I wyshed my selfe damned (yf it myghte haue ben) to saue my brethren. And all my brethren that receaued Christ receaued the same commaundement, and grewe therin. And they that were perfect loued me and all theyr other brethren, no lesse then I loued them. And loke w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> what loue I ministred y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gyftes of grace whych I receaued of Christ for the edifyenge of his congregacion, vpon my brethrē, wyth the same loue dyd they ministre theyr gyf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes agayne on me, whiche they had, and I lacked. And so loue made all commune. And moreouer yf they call my workes my merytes, I bestowed all my workes vpon my brethren to teach them, &amp; reaped the feute therof, euen my brethrens edify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enge and soules health, yee &amp; reape day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that I lefte my doctrine and ensam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of lyuynge behynde me, by the whych many are conuerted vnto Christ daylye. Yf thou desyre therfore to enioye parte of my merytes, go and reade in my gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and thou shalt fynde the frute of my
<pb facs="tcp:176389:35"/> laboure, the knowlege of Christ, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> health of thy soule, and euerlastynge lyfe.</p>
               <p>And as I loued my brethren whē I ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, so I loue them styll, and nowe more perfectly. How be it my loue then was paynfull: for the more I loued, the more I sorowed, feared, and cared for them, to brynge them in to the knowlege of the truth, and to kepe them in vnite of fayth, lest the false Prophetes shulde deceaue them, or theyr owne infirmytyes shulde breake peace and vnite, or cause them to fall into ony synne.</p>
               <p>But now my loue is without payne. For I se the wyl and prouidence of God, and howe the ende of all thynges shalbe vnto his glory and profyte of the electe. And though I se the electe shall somtyme fall, yet I se how they shall aryse agayne, and how that theyr fall shalbe vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of God &amp; theyr owne profyte. And we that are in heauen, loue you all alyke nother loue we one more &amp; another lesse. And therfore yf ye loue vs more one thē another, that is fleshly, as myne olde Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinthians once loued, and I rebuked thē. Nother can we be moued to come more to helpe one then another. But we wayt when God wyl sende ony of vs vnto the
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:176389:35"/> electe that call for helpe in Christes name. Wherfore yf thou wylte be holpē of ony of vs, praye in Christes name, and God shall sende one of vs, an angell or a saynt, to kepe the power of the deuels from you: but not whome thou woldest chose, temptynge God, but whome it pleaseth God to sende.</p>
               <p>And yf youre preachers loue you not af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thesame maner, to edyfye you with the true doctrine of Christe, and ensample of lyuynge ther after, and to kepe you in vny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye of fayth &amp; charite, they be not of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes disciples, but Antichrist, which vnder the name of Christe, seke to raygne ouer you as temporal tyraūtes.

               <p>Antichrist is one of the fyrste that seyth the lyghte, and cōmeth &amp; preacheth Christe a whyle and seketh hys glorye in Christes Gospell.

               <p>The Apostles were cleare eyed, and espyed Antichrist at once, and put hym to flyght, &amp; weded out hys doctrine quyckly.

               <p>The byshop of Rome made a lawe of his owne to rule his church by, and put Christes out of the waye. All the byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes sweare vnto the byshoppe of Rome,

But all the textes

                  <hi>ashamed of hym at hys cōmynge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two thynges to be marked: one yf we cleue vnto Christ after the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apostles and as they buylt vs vpon hym, we shalbe bolde and sure of our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues at hys cōmyng, as a seruaūt, which in hys maysters absence doeth onely hys maysters commaundementes, can not be confoūded at hys cōmynge home agayne. But and yf we followe mēs doctrine, how can we be bolde? yee how shulde we not be ashamed wyth our teachers? vnto whom he shall than saye (whan they boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, how that they haue bene hys vyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) I knowe you not, departe from me ye that haue wrought wyckednesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my name haue brought in damnable sectes, and haue taught youre disciples to beleue in other thynges than in me. Now the summe of al that the Apostles taught, and how they buylt vs vpon Christ, is the new testament. But the Byshop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes doctrine is not there founded, but euē improued. Confounded therfore shal he be whyche wyttynge and wyllynge shutteth hys eyes at the true lyght, and openeth thē to beleue hys lyes.</p>
               <p>Another thynge is thys, al y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> scripture maketh mencion of the resurreccion and
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:176389:48"/> commynge agayne of Christ: and that all men, both they that go before, and they that come after shall then receaue theyr rewardes together, and we are commaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to loke euerye houre for that daye. And what is done wyth the soules from the departynge of theyr bodyes vnto that daye, doth the scripture make no mentiō, saue only y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they rest in the LORD and in theyr fayth. Wherfore he that determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ought of the state of them that be departed, doth but teach the presūptuouse ymaginations of hys owne brayne: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can hys doctrine be ony artycle of our fayth. What God doth wyth them, is a secret, layed vp in the treasury of God. And we ought to be pacient, beynge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed of the scripture, that they whiche dye in the fayth, are at rest, and ought no more to searche that secrete, thē to search the houre of the resurrection, which God hath put only in hys owne power. But thys remēbre, that the whole natur of mā is poysoned and infecte with synne: And the whole lyfe of sinne must be mortified. Nowe the roote of all synne and first vice that we were infecte wyth, is, that we wold be wyse, where God hath not taught vs, as ye se how Eue wolde haue bene as
<pb facs="tcp:176389:49"/> God in knowlege of good and bad. And therfore hath God hyd many thynges in hys power, and commaunded that we shal search none of hys secretes farther, then he hath openned them in hys scrypture, to mortifye thys poyson of all poysons, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre to appeare wyfe, &amp; that we be ashamed to be ignoraūt in ony thynge at all. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they that vyolently make articles of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> fayth wythout Gods worde are yet alyue in the roote of synne; and vice, and growe out of the deuel, and not out of Christe. And theyr articles are of the blyndnesse of the deuel, and not of the lyght of Christe for Christes lyghte hath testimonye of the scripture euery where.</p>

               <p>Oure nature is to worke wyckednesse and so blynde therto, that it cā se no righte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousnesse. And then it followeth that we must be borne a newe in Christ, yer we be or can ether do or yet know what is rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And in hym we must fyrst be made ryghteous oure selues, yer we can worke ryghteous workes, whyche conclusion is contrarye vnto the B. of Rome. For he sayeth that the workes do make the man
<pb n="L" facs="tcp:176389:49"/> ryghteous, and Christes doctryne sayeth: that the man maketh the workes ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A righteous mā spryngeth out of righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous workes sayeth the B. of Romes doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine, ryghteous workes sprynge oute of a ryghteous man, &amp; a ryghteous mā spryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of Christ, sayth Christes doctrin. The workes make the man ryghteous that before was wycked sayeth the B. of Rome, the workes declare that the man is ryghteous sayeth Christes doctrine, but y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> man was fyrst made ryghteous in Christ and the sprite of Christe taught hym what ryghteousnesse was, and healed hys harte, and made hym consent therto, and to haue hys luste in ryghteousnesse, and to worke ryghteously.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The fayth and hope of a christen man, are no dead, ydle, or baren thynges: but lyuely, workynge and frutefull. For when the law thorowe conscience of synne hath slayne the soule, then hope and truste in Christes bloude thorowe certifyenge of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> conscience that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> damnacion of the lawe is taken awaye, quycken her agayne, and make her to loue the lawe, whiche is the purifyenge of the soule and hyr lyfe, and seruynge the lawe in the inner man. And then the sayde gyftes of hope and faythe stretch themselues forth vnto the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, dead with natural lust, consent, and custome to synne, and quicken them, and purge them, with the wholsome penaūce of Christes doctrine, and make thē serue the lawe outwarde, and beare wholsome frute of loue, vnto the profyte of theyr neghbours, accordynge to Christes loue vnto vs. For yf the sprete of Christe <note place="margin">The faythe of a Christē man.</note> (with the whiche God anoynteth vs, and

<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:176389:51"/> in Christ, and loue thy neghboure. And these two poyntes are the interpretynge and expoūdyng of all lawes, so that what so euer edifieth in fayth and loue, is to be kepte, as longe as it so doeth. And what so euer hurteth fayth or loue, is to be bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken immediatly, though bishop, kinge, em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour or an angel cōmaūde it.

So that yf they wyl synne agaynst God, and ouerlade our backes, we maye well runne awaye, yf we can escape, but not auenge our selues. But and yf they wyll breake into thy conscience, as the byshop of Rome doeth with his domme traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; sayeth, to do this saueth thy soule, and to leaue it vndone loseth thy soule, then defye them as the workes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, for they make the synne agaynst y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> faythe that is in Christes bloude, by the which only thy soule is saued, &amp; for lacke of that only, damned. And how loue brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> lawe, take an ensāple: It is a good <note place="margin">Loue brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> law.</note> lawe that men come to the church on the sondayes to heare Gods worde, and to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue the sacrament of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, in a remembraunce of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefytes

And thus all lawes are vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der loue and geue rowm to loue. And loue interpreteth thē: yee and breaketh them at a tyme, thoughe God hymselfe cōmaunde them.

               <p>God and the deuell are two contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry fathers, two contrary fountaynes, an two contrary causes: the one of all good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:176389:53"/> the other of all euell. And they that do euell, are borne of the deuell, and fyrste euel by that byrth, yer they be euell. For <note place="margin">The mā is fyrst euel.</note> yer a man do euell outwarde of purpose, he conceaued y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euell fyrst in his mynde, &amp; consented vnto it, and so was euel in his harte yer he wrought euell: and yer he cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued euel in his harte, he was borne of the deuel, and hadde receaued of hys sede and nature: By the reason of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, sede and byrth, he worketh euell na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and can do none other. As Christ sayeth Ioh. viii. Ye are of the father y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, and therfore wyl do the lustes of your father, for it is a cōmune prouerbe: The chylde followeth his fathers nature.</p>
               <p>And on the other syde, they that do <note place="margin">The mā is fyrst good.</note> good, are fyrst borne of God, and receaue of his nature &amp; sede, and by the reason of that nature and sede, are fyrste good yer they do good by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> same rule. And Christe which is contrarye to the deuell came to destroye the workes of the deuel in vs, and to geue vs a newe byrth, a new nature, and to sow new sede in vs, that we shulde by the reasō of that byrth, synne nomore. For the sede of that byrth, that is to wete the sprete of God, and the lyuely sede of his worde, sowen in oure hartes, kepeth
<pb facs="tcp:176389:54"/> oure hartes that we can not consente to synne, as the sede of the deuell holdeth the hartes of hys, that they can not consente to God. Thys is contrarye vnto the B. of Rome in two poyntes: In the one that he sayeth, that oure good dedes make vs fyrst good, and teacheth vs not to beleue in Christes bloud, there to be washed &amp; made fyrst good. And in another, that he sayeth, God choseth vs fyrst for our good qualy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and properties, and for the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēte and good endeuoure of our frewyll. What good endeuoure is there where the deuell possesseth the whole harte, that it cā consente to no good?</p>
               <p>And fynally ther is greate difference betwene the synne of them that beleue in <note place="margin">The fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull synne dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly.</note> Christ vnfaynedly, and the synne of them that beleue not. For they that beleue, syn not of purpose &amp; consente to wyckednesse that it is good, castynge and compassyng aforehande wythout grudge of conscience to brynge theyr purpose aboute. Theyr fathers conceaued myschefe these eyghte hundreth yeares ago, and the sonnes consente vnto the same, and haue no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to departe there from. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theyr synne is deuelysh and vnder the damnacion of the lawe. But yf he that
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:176389:54"/> beleueth synne, he doth it not of purpose, or y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> he consenteth vnto the lyfe of synne, but of infirmytie, chaūce, and some greate temptacion that hath ouercome hym. And therfore hys synne is veniall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy and grace, thoughe it be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thefte, or adultery, and not vnder the damnacion of the lawe. So that hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall scourge hym, but not caste hym awaye or damne hym. Marke the synne of Saul and of Dauid.

Yf nowe euery christen man oughte to haue thys rule of hys profession before hys eyes to learne it, that he shulde loue hys brother as Christe dyd hym, to departe wyth hys lyfe for hys brothers ensample, how farre are they of from good scolers, that can not fynde in theyr hartes to departe with a lytle of the abundaunce and superfluyte of theyr temporall goodes, to helpe theyr neghbours nede?</p>

               </p>
               <p>What soeuer opinion ony membre of Antichriste holdeth, the grounde of all hys doctrine is to destroye this article of our fayth, that Christ is come in the flesh. For though the mooste parte of all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tykes confesse that Christe is come in the fleshe after theyr maner, yet they denye that he is come as the scripture testifyeth, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostles preached hym to be come. The whole studye of the deuell and all hys membres is, to destroye the hope and truste that we shulde haue in Christes fleshe, and in those thynges whyche he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred for vs in hys fleshe, and in the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and promyses of mercy, whyche are made vs in hys fleshe. For the scripture testifyeth, that Christe hath taken awaye the synne of the worlde in his fleshe, and that at thesame houre that he yelded vp hys sprete into the handes of hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:176389:59"/> he had full purged and made ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaccion for all the synnes of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> worlde. So that all the synne of the worlde, both before his passyon and after, must be put awaye thorowe repentaunce towarde the law, &amp; fayth and trust in his bloude, without respecte of ony other satisfaccion, sacrifyce or worke. For yf I once synne, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> lawe rebuketh my cōscyence, and setteth variaunce betwene God and me. And I shall neuer be at peace with God agayn vntyl I haue herde y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> voyce of his mouth, howe that my synne is forgeuen me for Christes bloude sake: And as soone as I beleue that, I am at peace with God.

We were stone deade and wythout lyfe or power to do or cōsent to good. The whole nature of vs was captiue vnder the deuel, and led at hys wyll. And we were as wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as the deuell now is, (Excepte that be now synneth agaynst the holy goost,) and we consented vnto synne, wyth soule and
<pb facs="tcp:176389:63"/> body, and hated the lawe of God. But god of hys grace only quyckened vs in Christ, and raysed vs out of that death, and made vs syt wyth Christ in heauenly thynges. That is: he set our hartes at reste &amp; made vs syt fast in the lyfe of Christes doctrine and vnmoueable from the loue of Christe. And fynally, we are in thys oure seconde byrth Gods workemanship and creacion in Christ: so that as he whyche is yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, hath no lyfe nor power to worke, no more had we tyll we were made agayne in Christ.

               <p>Yf we felte the loue of God in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bloude, we could not but loue agayne, not only God and Christ, but also al that are bought wyth Christes bloude.

                  <hi>No man hath at ony tyme sene God. Yf vve loue one another, God dvvelleth in vs, and hys loue is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte in vs.</hi>

For to loue God truely, and to geue hym thankes, is only to loue oure negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure for hys sake. For vpon hys persone thou canst bestowe no benefyte. And for so much as we neuer sawe God, let vs make no ymage of hym, nor do hym ony ymage

Blynd reasō sayeth: god is a kerued post and wyl be serued with a Candle. But scripture sayeth: God is loue, and wyl be serued with loue.

               <p>Fyrst the Apostles taught no fables, but that they sawe and receaued of God, by the wytnesse of hys sprite. Secōdaryly Ihon ascendeth vp one step hyer, frō loue to fayth, and sayeth: He that beleueth that Iesus is Gods sonne, hath God in hym. And I doubte not but the B. of Rome and hys defenders wyll answere Ihon, and saye: Thē the deuel hath God in hym, and is also in God. For other fayth, thē suche as y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> deuel hath, felte they neuer ony. But Ihon preuenteth thē sayeng: we haue kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen and beleued the loue that God hath to vs. That is, we beleue not only wyth story fayth, as men beleue olde cronicles, but we beleue the loue and mercye that God shewed vs, and put oure trust and confidence ther in: (and so taketh scriptur belefe) We beleue that Iesus is the sonne of God, became man, and was slayne for oure synnes, whiche is a token of greate loue. And that loue beleue we, and truste therto. Where Paule sayeth .i. Corint. xii No mā can cal Iesus LORDE (except the

He meaneth not wyth the mouth only, but in the harte w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> vnfayned fayth, puttynge his hope and trust in the lordship which he hath ouersynne, dānaciō hel and death.

               <p>But yet how shal I se my fayth? I must come downe to loue agayne, and thence to the workes of loue, yer I can se my faythe. Not alwaye, but somtyme y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> shalt fele thy fayth without y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> outward dede, as in great aduersite &amp; persecution, when the deuel as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulteth the with desperation, &amp; layeth thy synnes before the, &amp; wolde beare the in hāde that God had cast the away, &amp; left the suc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>currelesse, for thy synnes sake, then cōmeth fayth forth w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hyr shyld, and turneth backe agayn the dartes of the deuel, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: Nay, for Iesus is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sonne of God: yee and my very God, &amp; my very LORD, and hath taken awaye my synnes &amp; all damna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciō.

                  <hi>God is loue, and he that abydeth in loue, abydeth in God, and God in hym.</hi>

               <p>Thys haue we herde aboue, and it is easy to be vnderstonde.</p>

For perfecte loue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to make a man bold, because it is the kepynge of the commaundementes. And therfore he that is perfecte in loue, when he seyth hymselfe (yet in thys worlde) to be vnto his neghboure as God is vnto him, &amp; to be lyke his heauēly father in all ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of kyndnesse, is bolde in the presence of God: yee though he come to iudge syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners. When on the other syde, they that cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinue euer in theyr wyckednesse, &amp; growe not in loue, fall often. And therfore theyr conscience euer accuseth them, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them in feare, by the reason of the freshe memory of the offence, that they
<pb facs="tcp:176389:66"/> can not attōce be bold, though they haue neuer so great promyse of mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ther is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth oute feare: For feare hath paynfulnesse. He therfore that feareth, is not perfecte in loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Loue is not paynfull, but maketh all thynge easy &amp; pleasaunt. Feare of punysh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the trespasse newly commytted, is paynfull: Therfore where loue is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, there is no such feare. Loue is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyllynge <note place="margin">Loue.</note> of the commaundementes, and therfore where loue is perfecte, there is no synne. And where the conscience doth not accuse of synne, there is fayth bolde to go in to God, and to stande before him, and loke hym in the face, and to coniure hym by all his mercyes, and to axe the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titions of his desyre. Lacke of loue is the breakynge of the commaundementes, &amp; cause of synne. And where the cōscience accuseth of synne, there fayth is abashed, dismade, ashamed, and afrayed to go in, for fear of rebuke. Loue therfore serueth to make a man bolde in the daye of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, and in all temptacions.</p>
               <p>Ihon speaketh not generally of all <note place="margin">Feare.</note> maner feare, but of that only, whiche the conscience of synne putteth a man in.
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:176389:66"/> For dyuerse feares ther be that accompa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny loue, and growe as she doeth.

Euen so the more we loue our brethren, the more we care for them, and feare lest ony tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion shulde trouble them. As Paule sayeth .ii. Corin. xi Who is sycke, and I am not sycke? who is offended or hurte, &amp; myne harte burneth not?

And tel me I praye the, who so euer hath had experience, what a payne and grefe, yee and what a fretting corrosefe is it vnto the harte of a true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of God, to heare the poyson genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of vypers, the pestilente secte of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritish pharises, wyttyngly &amp; wyllyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to blaspheme and rayle on the opē and manyfest truth of the holy goost?</p>
               <p>Yf ye wyll se how bolde loue is, go to Moses, Exodi. the .xxxii. Chapter, and Numeri the .xiiii. Chapter, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde

As who shulde saye, they be thy people, &amp; thou commaundest me to loue them, and for thy sake I loue them, and teach them, and care for them as a mother that had borne them, and loue them no lesse then my selfe. Wherfore yf thou loue me as thou promysest me, then saue them with me: or yf not, then cast me awaye wyth them, and let me haue suche parte as they take. And Paule sayd as muche Roma. ix. Loke vpon worldly loue, and se what pagientes she playeth now &amp; then, and how dronken a thynge it is: &amp; be sure where the loue of God is perfect, she wyl not onely go betwene bodely death and hyr louer, but also betwene hym and hell. Yf a man wolde take of this, that a man myght be so perfyte in this lyfe, that he might not be perfyter, it wold not follow. For though the sprete at a tyme get the vpperhande of the fleshe, and wynneth her selfe so to God, that she can not tell whether she be in the body or no: yet the fleshe wyll pull her downe agayne, &amp; not let her continue, and now &amp; then plucke of some of hyr fethers, for mountynge so

The sprete thorowe faythe certifyeth my conscience that my synnes are forgeuen, and I recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnder grace, and made the very sonne of God, and beloued of God. And than naturally myne harte breaketh oute into the loue of God agayne, and I seke how to vtter my loue, and to do God some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And because I can nother do seruyce or pleasure vnto hys owne personne, my neghboure is before me, to do God seruice and pleasure in hym, and to be to hym as Christ is to me, because he is my brother, bought wyth Christes bloude as I am. And I consent vnto that lawe, and loue it yer I come at the dede, and longe after the dede. And than whā I loue my neghboure in the dede accordynge to thys lawe, I am sure that I loue hym truly. Or els yf I examined not my loue by thys lawe, I myght be deceaued. For some loue theyr neghboures for pleasure, profite, glory and for theyr doynge seruice only, as oure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualty

But Gods lawe is, that I shulde absteyne from myne owne pleasure and profyte, and become my neghboures seruaunte, and bestow lyfe and goodes vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon hym, after the ensample of Christe. Wherfore yf I loue myne neghboure out of the loue of Christe, and after the ensam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of hys lawe, I am sure that I loue hym truely.</p>

               <p>To loue is not paynfull: the cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes are but loue: therfore they be not greuous, because loue maketh the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes easy.

               <p>Christe came with .iii. wytnesses, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bloude, and sprite.

               <p>We reade in the histories that whan a loue daye, or a truce was made betwene man and man, the conuenauntes were rehearsed: and vpon that, they slewe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes in a memorial and remembraunce of the appoyntment only.

               <p>Euen so oure ymages, relyques, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and sacramentes were oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and sygnes of remembraunce on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.

And lykewyse yf a man had ben taken in open synne, agaynst the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessyon of his baptyme, he was rebuked openly.

               <p>And to begynne wythall, they sayde <hi>Confiteor,</hi> and knowleged themselues to be synners. And then the prest prayed in generall for al estates and degrees and for encreace of grace, and in especyall, yf nede requyred: vnto whiche prayers the people herkened and sayde. <hi>Amen.</hi> And then the Gospell and glad tydynges of forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of synnes was preached, to steare vp our fayth. And then the sacrament was mynistred for the confyrmacion of the faythe of the Gospel, and of the testament made betwene God and vs of forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of synnes in Christes bloude, for oure repentaunce and faythe: as ye se how after all bargens ther is a sygne therof

            <p>Thys all is the tytle and superscripci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the Epistle or lettre, wherein (to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme it the more) he setteth hys name, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to whome he wryteth it, and an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall salutacion or wysshynge. And is as much to say: as I Ihon the Elder wryt thys Epistle vnto the faythfull congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and vnto the same I wysh grace and peace, and that they perseuer or continue in the truth and loue. The cause why he
<pb facs="tcp:176389:87"/> calleth hymselfe the Elder and not Ihon I reken be, that it was moost vsed of euery man and commune, and full of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call swetnesse and authorite: not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the worshippe of age, but also by reason of the holy callynge and office. Moreouer he calleth the church or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion a lady, because she is the bryde of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> LORDE Iesus: and the membres of the church he calleth chyldren, remaynynge so styll in comparynge and aludynge. As for hys wyshynge is playne ynough, for it is so ryfe in other Epistles. But Ihon addeth Truth &amp; Loue, as hys maner is to dryue it, desyrynge them to be and continue ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in. The truth doth he set agaynst ypocrisy and erroure and lyes, that it be nothynge, but a true fayth. Charite conteyneth al ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ercyse of godlynesse.

For Christen charite ought to be without al simulacion &amp; ypocrisy. I loue them for the truthes sake, that is: because they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse the truth, do I loue thē. And not only
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:176389:87"/> do I loue thē, but also all they that knowe the truth, where by he rayseth vp theyr har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes and corages, and entyseth them to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeuoure of godlynesse.

            <p>He reasoneth of the harme or daunger, and these wordes seme to be taken oute of Ezechiell the .xviii.

            <p>It is a shorte &amp; pythy sentence to moue or admonyshe where he sayeth: loke on your selues, &amp; is as muche to saye, as: Let euery one beware, left he beynge rechelesse in that he hath wel begonne, lese all y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> frute of such good dedes as he hath hetherto wel accomplyshed: But rather passynge by all Antichristes doctours let vs so rūne, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we may receaue a ful rewarde: y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> which none do receaue, but such as endure vnto y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ende</p>

            <p>Here doth he now adde greater thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges. For it is a very great thynge to wāte God, and to haue nother the father nor y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> sonne. But he y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> abydeth not in the truth &amp; loue, he hath nother the father nor the sonne. Wherfore we ought to endeuoure and busyly to laboure that we procede in the waye of truth. Of this reade more in the .ii. Chapter of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> .i. epistle of S. Ihon.

The sayeng of Iesus Sirach in his boke Ecclesiasti. the .xiii.

By thys place
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:176389:94"/> it appeareth that ther were many good mē at that tyme, whyth followynge the ensā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Paule preached the Gospell frely vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Gentyles. For the men of the primi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyse church dyd so earnestly couet the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the LORDE Christ to be promoted and set forth, that for hys sake they dyd suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre and toke great payne for it. But they that were not ordyned to that office, gaue therto al theyr substaunce, that the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in the Gospell shulde want nothyng. And amonge suche was Gaius the chefest a ryche man as it semeth, whome Paule also Roma. xvi. calleth hys ooste and the ooste of all the congregacion. Besyde these also dyd many good men of the meane sort helpe to promote the Gospell lykewyse. And we (vnto whom the endes of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> world be come) lye snorkynge lyke sloggardes. They that are apte to teache, &amp; to whome God hath geuen grace in preachynge and facunde or welspeakynge, wyll not put thē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues, nor theyr substaunce in hasarde: ether wyll not take the laboure vpon thē, wythout they be wel anoynted wyth some fatte benefyce or stipende, and because few or none obtayne them, that be mete for it, therfore is that office so slackely executed. And agayne the Patrons wyll admytte
<pb facs="tcp:176389:95"/> none that be poore &amp; haue nought, though they be mete for it. Yee so farre we be from mynistrynge our substaunce to such, that we enuye and wythdrawe from them such stipende, as of longe tyme haue ben geuen of other to suche vse: and thus we se that y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> doctrine of godlynesse, &amp; the glory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes name do perysh.
